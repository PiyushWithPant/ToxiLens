---

### Dataset

The dataset used in ToxiLens is the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification dataset, which is available on Kaggle. This dataset contains a large collection of comments from various online platforms, labeled for toxicity. It is designed to help in the development of models that can detect and categorize toxic comments effectively.

You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data).

- **Total Comments**: Over 200,000
- **Labels**: Toxic, Severe Toxic, Obscene, Threat, Insult, Identity Hate
- **Usage**: Ideal for training machine learning models for natural language processing tasks related to comment moderation and toxicity detection.
